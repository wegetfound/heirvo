              <p>
                Heirvo is a desktop application for Windows. All disc reading, sector
                analysis, video reconstruction, and AI-based restoration happens
                locally, on the machine you installed it on. We do not have a cloud
                service that processes your media. We never see, copy, transmit, or
                store the discs you recover or the files those recoveries produce.
              </p>
              <p>
                If your computer is offline, Heirvo continues to work for everything
                except license validation and optional model downloads.

            <Section id="license-validation" title="2. License validation">
              <p>
                When you activate Heirvo Pro, the app sends your license key (and
                only your license key) to our license server to confirm it is valid
                and tied to your purchase. After activation, Heirvo re-checks the
                license roughly once per week. This lets us honor refunds and revoke
                keys that are reported as fraudulent.
              </p>
              <p>
                Validation requests do not include filenames, disc contents, file
                paths, machine identifiers beyond a coarse install token, or any
                personally identifiable information beyond what Lemon Squeezy
                already associates with your purchase.

              <p>
                The Heirvo desktop app contains no analytics SDK, no crash reporter
                that auto-uploads, no tracking pixels, no usage metrics. The only
                outbound network requests the app makes are:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>License validation, as described above.</li>
                <li>
                  Downloads of FFmpeg and AI restoration models &mdash; only when
                  you explicitly choose to enable those features. You see a clear
                  prompt before any download begins.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                If you never enable AI restoration and never need FFmpeg, Heirvo
                makes no media-related network requests at all.

                The marketing website you are reading right now may use a minimal,
                privacy-respecting analytics tool such as Plausible or Fathom. These
                tools do not set cookies, do not track you across sites, do not
                build advertising profiles, and do not collect personal data. They
                count anonymous page views so we can tell whether anyone is finding
                the site.
              </p>
              <p>
                We do not run Google Analytics, Facebook Pixel, or any third-party
                advertising tracker on heirvo.com.
